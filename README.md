# System Description
We would like to develop a mobile application that allows users to keep track of their shopping list in a simple format. They can add new items to the list and cross them out when picked up. Our application provides a list of items currently in their refrigerator along with an estimated expiry date. Users can add expiry dates manually and can also sync multiple accounts together. All shopping lists and refrigerator contents are accessible on synced accounts.
