## Business Description

Keeping track of shopping lists can be a difficult task. People forget to write them and even if they did write it on a piece of paper, it might get lost. A bigger challenge is coordinating a list of items with multiple people when shopping. If not done correctly it might result in duplicate purchases. Additionally, tracking refrigerator contents or checking the expiry date of every item is a time consuming task however, if not done it can result in spoiled food on a daily basis.

Our app allows users to keep track of their shopping list in a simple format. They can add new items to the list and cross them when picked up. Our app provides a list of items currently in their refrigerator along with an estimated expiry date. Users can add expiry dates either manually or by using our expiry estimator that suggest expiry dates based on the product. The app can sync multiple accounts together which is perfect for busy families. All shopping lists and refrigerator contents are accessible on synced accounts.
